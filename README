AppleTree - The only standalone apple tree plugin. 


AppleTree is a very simple plugin that was designed with the sole idea of turning trees into apple trees. There is a configuration file that will be created in the same folder as craftbukkit called appletree.properties, which you can use to customize different aspects of the plugin.

Properties Guide:
AChance - (number between 0 and 1) The chance of an apple drop. 5% = 0.05
CanDropGold - (true/false) If golden apples can drop.
GAChance - (number between 0 and 1) The chance of a golden apple drop. 5% = 0.05
CanDropCocoa= (true/false) If cocoa beans can drop.
CBChance=(number between 0 and 1) The chance of a cocoa bean drop.
DropLeaves - (true/false) if all leaves drop leaves (when broken)
CanDropDecay - (true/false) Whether or not apples drop on decaying leaves.
 - if true, there are other settings for decay drop probabilities
 - DecayAChance, DecayCanDropGold, DecayGAChance, DecayCanDropCocoa, DecayDropLeaves

Features: 
Apples spawn from destroyed leaves.
Chance to spawn golden apples or Cocoa Beans as well.
